I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. My research focuses on how citizens hold elected officials accountable in democracies. I am particularly interested in the consequences of electoral reforms in the United States for the behavior of voters, the behavior of elected officials, and policy outcomes. My CV can be found [here](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/CV.pdf).

**Working Papers:** 

*   [**"How Electoral Institutions Affect Political Accountability: Evidence from All-Mail Elections"**](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/VBM_V6.pdf)  
A central question in the study of democratic governance concerns the conditions under which voters can make informed choices at the ballot box. I exploit the staggered implementation of an electoral reform in a U.S. state to study the effects of electoral institutions on voter information and political accountability. I find that all-mail elections cause a decrease in ballot roll-off on statewide ballot measures in presidential election years, which is consistent with my argument that voters gather more information about politics when voting by mail. Further, switching from traditional polling place elections to vote-by-mail results in a decrease in negative findings on accountability audit reports and a decrease in taxing and spending in municipal governments. Using data from the Catalist voter file I show that these results cannot be explained by changes in the composition of the electorate caused by vote-by-mail.

*   [**"Voting Restrictions and Representation in Congress"**](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/voting_restrictions_representation.pdf)    
State and local governments have implemented a number of election administration policies that restrict access to the ballot. What are the effects of these electoral reforms on who votes and the behavior of elected officials? In this paper, I trace out the effects of restrictive voting laws on voter behavior in congressional elections, the outcomes of these elections, and, consequently, the behavior of members of the House of Representative using two complimentary identification strategies. First, I use the *Shelby County v. Holder* Supreme Court decision, which struck down the preclearance formula of the Voting Rights Act, as an instrument for the implementation of voting restrictions. Second, I collect a panel dataset of election laws in the American states and exploit cross-sectional and over time variation in election administration to estimate the within-congressional district and within-legislator effects of restrictive voting laws. I find that voting restrictions cause the median voter in congressional districts to shift to the right on the ideological spectrum. As a result, the implementation of voting restrictions causes the election of more conservative legislators that are also less likely to cosponsor legislation related to civil rights issues. 

*   **"Does Vote-by-Mail Cause Voters to Gather More Information about Politics?"**     
I theorize that vote-by-mail changes voter behavior and increases the likelihood that citizens gather relevant political information before voting. This is because vote-by-mail voters have additional time with their ballot and access to resources to conduct research about races on the ballot that they know nothing about. When voting at a polling place, however, voters are unable to find information about unknown candidates and issues that they see on the ballot. As a result, using vote-by-mail will cause voters to be more informed than when they cast their ballots at a polling place. I test this hypothesis with data from an original survey of eligible voters in California during the 2018 general election. The empirical analysis exploits the implementation of the California Voter's Choice Act (VCA) during this election, which resulted in five counties in the state switching to a mail ballot election system. Using difference-in-differences and instrumental variables research designs, I find that voting by mail causes an increase in voter knowledge and an increase in time that voters spend gathering information about the election. Voters who use vote-by-mail are also more likely to report that they felt informed about the races on the ballot when voting. As predicted, the effects are driven by voters who were least interested in the election. These findings have broad implications for our understanding of how electoral reforms affect voter behavior and political accountability.

*   **"The Effects of Community Income Inequality on Political Participation"** (with Melody Crowder-Meyer)     
In this paper we argue that community level income inequality affects political participation. We theorize that local experiences of inequality increase awareness of the unequal distribution of income in the US, provoking political activity. However, these increases in participation will be concentrated among those with more resources. Using restricted geographic data from the 2012 and 2016 ANES, we find local income inequality increases political participation, particularly among higher income individuals. Using an instrumental variables design, we demonstrate these findings are not the result of reverse causality. Our results reveal the importance of considering both individual and community level factors when evaluating political behavior. They also suggest that as income inequality in the US continues to rise, so too will the gap in political participation between the rich and the poor, which could lead elected officials to be even less responsive to the preferences and needs of the less affluent. 

*   **"The Polarization Dynamics of Electoral Reforms"** (with Zachary Peskowitz)     
Electoral reforms affect legislative outcomes by influencing incumbent legislators' behavior, new entrants' behavior, and the probability that incumbents are replaced with new entrants. Empirical work on electoral reforms and polarization has focused on new entrants' behavior. We employ a simple decision theoretic framework with partial incumbent policy persistence and spatial voting to examine the three channels jointly. We show that the magnitude of the reform's effect on ideological polarization is larger when the reform is implemented than when it is removed. The key insight is that implementing a moderation-inducing reform generates a set of challengers who are more likely to defeat incumbents relative to removing the reform. We then empirically examine how elections and legislative polarization respond to unlimited PAC contributions in state legislatures. Examining incumbents' decisions to stand for reelection, the electoral performance of incumbents who do run, and partisan polarization, we find empirical support for our predictions.

[**"How Electoral Institutions Affect Political Accountability: Evidence from Vote-by-Mail in Washington"**](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/VBM_and_Electoral_Accountability_V4.pdf) (Under Review)

In this paper, I exploit the staggered implementation of vote-by-mail in Washington to estimate the effects of all-mail elections on the behavior of voters, elected officials, and policy outcomes in the state's municipalities. Using a difference-in-differences design, I find that vote-by-mail causes a decrease in ballot roll-off on statewide ballot measures in presidential election years, which is consistent with my argument that voters gather more information about politics when voting in all-mail elections. Further, switching from traditional polling place elections to vote-by-mail results in a decrease in negative findings on accountability audit reports and a decrease in taxing and spending in Washington's municipalities. Using data from the Catalist voter file I show that these results cannot be explained by changes in the composition of the electorate caused by vote-by-mail. 

**"Voting Restrictions and Representation in Congress"**

State and local governments have implemented a number of election administration policies that restrict access to the ballot. What are the effects of these election laws on who votes and, consequently, the behavior of elected officials? In this paper, I answer this question by estimating the effects of restrictive voting laws on the composition of the electorate and congressional behavior using two complementary identification strategies. First, I use the *Shelby County v. Holder* Supreme Court decision, which struck down the preclearance formula of the Voting Rights Act and gave many local jurisdictions the ability to change election administration policy without approval from the federal government, as an instrument for the implementation of voting restrictions. Second, I collect a panel dataset of election laws in the American states from 2000 - 2016 and exploit cross-sectional and overtime variation in election policy to estimate the effects of restrictive voting laws. This paper has implications for our understanding of electoral politics and representation in Congress.  

**"The Effects of Community Income Inequality on Political Participation" (with Melody Crowder-Meyer)**

Income inequality is on the rise in America, yet we know little about how economic inequality shapes political engagement. In this paper, we use the restricted data file from the 2012 American National Election Study and U.S. Census data to examine the effects of income inequality at the community level on individual and social forms of political participation. We theorize that inequality will have different effects on these two types of participation and that these effects will be conditioned by individual-level socioeconomic status. We find that for higher socioeconomic status individuals, greater income inequality increases both individual and social forms of participation, while increases in income inequality diminish social participation among those with low socioeconomic status. Our study indicates that rising levels of income inequality will perpetuate the participatory gap between high and low socioeconomic status individuals and lead to policies that further benefit higher status Americans over those with fewer resources.

I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. My research focuses on how citizens hold elected officials accountable in democracies. I am particularly interested in the consequences of electoral reforms in the United States for the behavior of voters, the behavior of elected officials, and policy outcomes. My CV can be found [here](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/CV.pdf).

**Working Papers:** 

*   **["How Electoral Institutions Affect Political Accountability: Evidence from All-Mail Elections"](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/VBM_V6.pdf )**  
A central question in the study of democratic governance concerns the conditions under which voters can make informed choices at the ballot box. I exploit the staggered implementation of an electoral reform in a U.S. state to study the effects of electoral institutions on voter information and political accountability. I find that all-mail elections cause a decrease in ballot roll-off on statewide ballot measures in presidential election years, which is consistent with my argument that voters gather more information about politics when voting by mail. Further, switching from traditional polling place elections to vote-by-mail results in a decrease in negative findings on accountability audit reports and a decrease in taxing and spending in municipal governments. Using data from the Catalist voter file I show that these results cannot be explained by changes in the composition of the electorate caused by vote-by-mail.

*   **"Voting Restrictions and Representation in Congress"**  
State and local governments have implemented a number of election administration policies that restrict access to the ballot. What are the effects of these electoral reforms on who votes and the behavior of elected officials? In this paper, I trace out the effects of restrictive voting laws on voter behavior in congressional elections and, consequently, the behavior of members of the House of Representative using two complimentary identification strategies. First, I use the *Shelby County v. Holder* Supreme Court decision, which struck down the preclearance formula of the Voting Rights Act, as an instrument for the implementation of voting restrictions. Second, I collect a panel dataset of election laws in the American states and exploit cross-sectional and over time variation in election administration to estimate the within-congressional district and within-legislator effects of restrictive voting laws. I find that voting restrictions cause the median voter in congressional districts to shift to the right on the ideological spectrum. As a result, the implementation of voting restrictions causes the election of more conservative legislators that are also less likely to cosponsor legislation related to civil rights issues. 

*   **"The Effects of Community Income Inequality on Political Participation" (with Melody Crowder-Meyer)**  
Income inequality is on the rise in America, yet we know little about how economic inequality shapes political engagement. In this paper, we use the restricted data file from the 2012 American National Election Study and U.S. Census data to examine the effects of income inequality at the community level on individual and social forms of political participation. We theorize that inequality will have different effects on these two types of participation and that these effects will be conditioned by individual-level socioeconomic status. We find that for higher socioeconomic status individuals, greater income inequality increases both individual and social forms of participation, while increases in income inequality diminish social participation among those with low socioeconomic status. Our study indicates that rising levels of income inequality will perpetuate the participatory gap between high and low socioeconomic status individuals and lead to policies that further benefit higher status Americans over those with fewer resources.

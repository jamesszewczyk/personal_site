I am a PhD student in the Department of Political Science at Emory University. My research focuses on how citizens hold elected officials accountable in democracies. I am particularly interested in the consequences of electoral reforms in the United States for the behavior of voters, the behavior of elected officials, and policy outcomes. My CV can be found [here](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/CV.pdf).

**Working Papers:** 

*   **"Does Vote-by-Mail Cause Voters to Gather More Information about Politics?"**     
In this paper, I examine the effects of vote-by-mail on voter behavior and voter knowledge. I argue that vote-by-mail electoral systems result in a more informed electorate, because voters have additional time with their ballot and access to resources to conduct research about races on the ballot that they know nothing about. I present the results of two empirical studies that support this prediction. First, I find that all-mail elections in Utah cause a 6.368 percentage point decrease in straight ticket voting. This is consistent with the logic that voters spend more time with their ballots when voting by mail relative to when they are voting at a polling place. Second, I estimate the effects of vote-by-mail on voter knowledge using an original repeated cross-sectional survey that was fielded during the 2018 general election in California. The research design exploits the implementation of the California Voter’s Choice Act (VCA), which resulted in five counties in the state switching to an election system in which all voters in the counties are sent a mail-in ballot. I find that the VCA causes an increase in voter knowledge and an increase in time that voters spend gathering information about the election. However, the reform does not affect the prevalence of political discussion or levels of knowledge about the party identification and ideology of candidates. 

*   [**"How Electoral Institutions Affect Political Accountability: Evidence from All-Mail Elections"**](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/VBM_V7.pdf)    
A central topic in the study of democratic governance concerns the conditions under which voters make
informed choices at the ballot box and are able to hold elected officials accountable. In this paper, I
exploit the staggered implementation of all-mail elections in Washington to study the effects of electoral institutions on political accountability. I find that all-mail elections cause a decrease in taxing and spending in the state’s municipalities. This is consistent with my argument that elected officials are more competent and responsive after the implementation of vote-by-mail, because the reform causes voters to gather more information about politics than they would when voting at a polling place. I present additional evidence to support my theory. In particular, I show that vote-by-mail causes a decrease in violations on accountability audits, an increase in turnout in municipal elections, and a decrease in ballot roll-off on statewide ballot measures. Using data on the characteristics of voters in municipal elections in Washington I show that the municipal finance results cannot be explained by changes in the composition of the electorate induced by all-mail elections.

*   [**"Voting Restrictions and Representation in Congress"**](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/voting_restrictions_representation.pdf)    
State and local governments have implemented a number of election administration policies that restrict access to the ballot. What are the effects of these electoral reforms on who votes and the behavior of elected officials? In this paper, I trace out the effects of restrictive voting laws on voter behavior in congressional elections, the outcomes of these elections, and, consequently, the behavior of members of the House of Representative using two complimentary identification strategies. First, I use the *Shelby County v. Holder* Supreme Court decision, which struck down the preclearance formula of the Voting Rights Act, as an instrument for the implementation of voting restrictions. Second, I collect a panel dataset of election laws in the American states and exploit cross-sectional and over time variation in election administration to estimate the within-congressional district and within-legislator effects of restrictive voting laws. I find that voting restrictions cause the median voter in congressional districts to shift to the right on the ideological spectrum. As a result, the implementation of voting restrictions causes the election of more conservative legislators that are also less likely to cosponsor legislation related to civil rights issues. 

*   [**"Community Income Inequality and the Economic Gap in Participation"**](http://jamesszewczyk.github.io/personal_site/Inequality_Participation_Public.pdf) (with Melody Crowder-Meyer)      
This paper reveals how community level income inequality affects political participation. We theorize that local experiences of inequality increase awareness of the unequal distribution of income in the US, provoking political activity, particularly among those with more resources enabling them to act. Using restricted geographic data from the 2012 and 2016 ANES, we show local income inequality increases political participation, especially among the affluent. Using an instrumental variables design, we demonstrate these findings are not the result of reverse causality. Our results demonstrate the importance of considering both individual and community level factors when evaluating political behavior. They also suggest that as income inequality in the US continues to rise, so too will the gap in political participation between the rich and the poor, potentially leading elected officials to be even less responsive to the preferences and needs of the less affluent. 

*   **"The Polarization Dynamics of Electoral Reforms"** (with Zachary Peskowitz)     
Electoral reforms affect legislative outcomes by influencing incumbent legislators' behavior, new entrants' behavior, and the probability that incumbents are replaced with new entrants. Empirical work on electoral reforms and polarization has focused on new entrants' behavior. We employ a simple decision theoretic framework with partial incumbent policy persistence and spatial voting to examine the three channels jointly. We show that a reform designed to encourage ideological moderation produces larger effects on polarization when the reform is implemented than when it is removed. The key insight is that implementing a moderation-inducing reform generates a set of challengers who are more likely to defeat incumbents while the incumbents are more likely to win reelection when the reform is removed. We then empirically examine how elections and legislative polarization respond to unlimited PAC contributions in state legislatures. Examining incumbents' decisions to stand for reelection, the electoral performance of incumbents who do run, and partisan polarization, we find empirical support for our predictions.
